## Data, Information , Knowledge , Wisdom
- Data - Basic , discrete , objective facts about something such as who, what, when, where ...
- Information - Collection of data organized and processed in such a way that they can add value; One of the most valuable organizational resources.
- Knowledge - Awareness and understanding of a systematic set of information and the ways it can be made useful.
- Wisdom - Knowledge to be applied to different situations. 
- Process or Procedure: A set of logically related tasks performed to achieve a defined outcome.
  > Turning data into information is a process / procedure.

#### Types of data 
|Data                     |Represented by
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Alphanumeric data       |Number , letters , and other characters 
| Audio data              |Sounds , noises , or tones
| Image data              |Graphic images and pictures
| Video data              |Moving images or pictures

## What is an Information System (IS)?
An **information system** (IS) is a systematic set of interrelated elements that:
- Collect (input)
- Process
- Store
- Disseminate data and information.
- Provides a feedback mechanism to monitor and control its operations to make sure it continues to meet organizational goals and objectives.
  
A **Computer-based informations system** (CBIS) is a set of hardware , software, databases, network , people , and procedures.
- Configured to collect, manipulate , store , and process data information.
- A.K.A. computer information systems (CIS)

**An organization's technology infrastructure** includes all the hardware , software , databases, network , people , and procedures
- That are configured to collect , manipulate , store , and process data into information.

## what is an Information System ?
- A **process of procedure** defines the steps to follow to achieve a specific and results
  > Such as enter a customer order, pay a supplier invoice , or request a current inventory report.
- Using an IS involves setting and follwoing many procedures, including those for:
  > Analysis , design , implementation , maintenance , and security of the information system.

## Information systems in Organizations
### 3 types of IS
- **Personal IS**: IS that improve the productivity of regular users.
- **Group IS**: IS that improve communications and support collaboration among members of a workgroup.
- **Enterprise IS**: IS that organizations use to define structued interactions among employees and/or customers , suppliers government agencies, etc.

## Hardware Devices 
### Hardware:
- Consists of computer equipment used to perform input, processing , storage, and output activities.
- A **trend** in IT industry is to produce smaller, faster , and more mobile and powerful hardware.
- Innovative new hardware devices:
> Advanced keyboards
> Laptops and display that connect wirelessly
>Very-high resolution display devices

## Software Applications

### Software
- Consists of computer programs that govern the operation of a computing device.
### Two types of software
- System Software - Operating systems: Oversee basic computer operations such as start-up, controls access to system resources , and manage memory and files.
- Applications software : Allows to accomplish specific tasks, including editing text documents, creating graphs , and playing games. 
### Business application software
- Can be categorized by whether it is used by an individual, a small business , or a large multinational enterprise.

## Database System
### Database
- An Organized collection of data and information, typically consisting of two or more related data files.
- For example, a database contain data and information on customers, employees, inventory, sales , online purchases, etc.
### Data Warehouse 
- A database that stores large amounts of historical data in a form that readily supports analysis and management decision making.

## Network and Cloud computing 

### Network 
- Connect computers and other computing equipment in a room, building campus , city ,or globe to enable electronic communication.

### Internet 
- **Internet of Things (IOT)** - A network of pysical objects embedded with sensors , processors,software, and network connectivity capability to enable them to exchange data with the manufacturer of the device, device operators , and other connected devices.
> Encompasses not only machine-to0machine but also people-to-people and people-to-machine connections.

- World's largest computer network.
> Enable communication , collaboration , search functions , and information sharing between member of an organization using a web browser.

>A network based on web technologies that allows selected outsiders to access authorized resources of a company's intranet.

### Cloud computing 
- A service provider organization owns and manages hardware, software , networking , and storage devices in order to provide shared resources to users via the internet.

## Business Information Systems (BIS)
- IS are used in all functional areas of business organizations: Business IS
> Accounting and finance 
> Customer service 
> Human resources
> Manufacturing 
> Research & Development 
> Sales & Marketing 


## Electronic Commerce and Mobile Technology
- **E-Commerce** involves the exchange of money for goods and services over electronic network. 

- Mobile commerce (m-commerce) The use of mobile , wireless devices to place orders and conduct business. 
- Used to support all forms of e-commerce
