## Chapter 2: Data Modeling 

### Learning objectives
- After completing this chapter, we will be able to:
    - discuss data modeling.
    - describe data-modeling building blocks.
    - define what business rules are and how they influence database design.

### Data Modeling and Data Models: A Clinical Case
- Student Demo:
    - go to a clinic.
    - see a doctor 
    - for medical/health situations( allments or illness)
    - The medical process, facts, events, objects ,entities , relationship,etc.

    Aliment(https://www.merriam-webster.com/):
    1. A bodily disorder or chronic disease; e.g. a stomach ailment.
    1. unrest, uneasiness, e.g., an emotional ailment.
### Data Modeling and Data Models

1. **Modeling**: A model abstracts the real world, focusing on a set of objects, events, or entities that are related in some way. 

1. **Data modeling**: creating a data model for  determinded problem domain in database design and implemetation:

- **Data model** Simple representation of the complex real-world data structures. 
> useful for supporting a specific problem domain in database.

### Data modeling blocks
1. **Entity**: Person, place, thing, or event about which data will be collected and stored.
- Attribute: characteristics of an entity.
- relationship: association between entities.
    - One-to-many(1:M): e.g., Course and class
    - Many-to many(M:N): e.g., student and class; physician and patient.
