### Part 1: Information Sytems in Perspective
> We begin by examining the topics covered in “Part 1: Information Systems in Perspective,” which includes an “An Introduction to Information Systems” and a discussion of “Information Systems in Organizations.”

Information is a certral concept of this book. The term is used in the title of the book, in this section, and in every chapter. To be an effective manager in any area 
of business, you need to understand that information is one of organizations's most valuble resourses. Information is no  the same thing as data , and knowledge is different from both data and information. These concepts will now be explained.

### Data, Information , and Knowledge 
**Data** consists of raw facts, such as an employee number, total hours worked in a week, an inventory part number, or the number of units peoduced on a production line. As shown in **Table 1.1** several types of data can represent these facts. 

**Information** is a collection of data organized and processed so that it has additional value beyond the value of the individual facts. For example, a sales data summarized so it shows the total sales for the month. providing information to customers can also help companies increase revenues and profits.For example , social shopping Wed site Kaboodle brings shoppers and sellers together electronically so they can share information and make recommendations while shopping online. The free exchange of information stimulates sales and helps ensure shoppers find better values.
 ### Table 1.1 types of data 
 |Data                       |Represented by 
 |---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
 |Alphanumeric data          |Numbers, letters, and other characters
 |Audio data                 |Sounds, noises,or tones
 |Image data                 |Graphic images and pictures 
 |Video dataw                |Moving images or pictures
 
Another way to appreciate the difference between data and information is to think of data as the individual items in a grocery list—crackers, bread, soup, cereal, coffee, dishwashing soap, and so on. The grocery list becomes much more valuable if the items in the list are arranged in order by the aisle in which they are found in the store—bread and cereal in aisle 1, crackers and soup in aisle 2, and so on. Data and information work the same way. Rules and relationships can be set up to organize data so it becomes useful, valuable information.

The value of the information created depends on the relationships defined among existing data. For instance, you could add specific identifiers to the items in the list to ensure that the shopper brings home the correct item—whole wheat bread and Kashi cereal in aisle 1, saltine crackers and chicken noodle soup in aisle 2, and so on. By doing so, you create a more useful grocery list.

Turning data into information is a **process**, or a set of logically related tasks performed to achieve a defined outcome. The process of defining relationships among data to create useful information requires **knowledge**, which is the awareness and understanding of a set of information and the ways in which that information can be made useful to support a specific task or reach a decision.

 In other words, information is essentially data made more useful through the application of knowledge. For instance, there are many brands and varieties of most items on a typical grocery list. To shop effectively, the grocery shopper needs to have an understanding of the needs and desires of those being shopped for so that he knows to purchase one can of Campbell’s (not the store brand!) low-sodium chicken noodle soup for the family member who is diabetic along with two cans of Campbell’s regular chicken noodle soup for everyone else.

 In some cases, people organize or process data mentally or manually. In other cases, they use a computer. This transformation process is shown in **Figure 1.1**.

 ### The Value of Information
 The value of information is directly linked to how it helps decision makers achieve their organization’s goals. Valuable information can help people perform tasks more efficiently and effectively. Many businesses assume that reports are based on correct, quality information, but, unfortunately, that is not always true. For example, Experian (a global information services firm that provides credit services, marketing services, decision analytics, and consumer services) estimates that on average, 22 percent of an organization’s customer contact data is wrong.Footnote Companies can easily waste over $100 per inaccurate customer contact data record on things like direct-mail marketing sent to wrong addresses and the inability to properly track leads. For an organization with 100,000 customers and a 22 percent error rate, that projects to a loss of $2.2 million.Footnote

### Characteristics of quality Information
Fundamental to the quality of a decision is the quality of the information used to reach that decision. Any organization that stresses the use of advanced information systems and sophisticated data analysis before information quality is doomed to make many wrong decisions. Table 1.2 lists the characteristics that determine the quality of information. The importance of each of these characteristics varies depending on the situation and the kind of decision you are trying to make. For example, with market intelligence data, some inaccuracy and incompleteness is acceptable, but timeliness is essential. Market intelligence data may alert you that a competitor is about to make a major price cut. The exact details and timing of the price cut may not be as important as being warned far enough in advance to plan how to react. On the other hand, accuracy and completeness are critical for data used in accounting for the management of company assets, such as cash, inventory, and equipment.

### What is an information system?
Another central concept of this book is that of an information system. People and organizations use information systems every day. An **information system (IS)** is a set of interrelated components that collect, process, store, and disseminate data and information; an information system provides a feedback mechanism to monitor and control its operation to make sure it continues to meet its goals and objectives. The feedback mechanism is critical to helping organizations achieve their goals, such as increasing profits or improving customer service.

A **computer-based information system (CBIS)** is a single set of hardware, software, databases, networks, people, and procedures that are configured to collect, manipulate, store, and process data into information. Increasingly, companies are incorporating computer-based information systems into their products and services. Investment companies offer their customers a wide range of powerful investment tools, including access to extensive online research. Automobiles are available with advanced navigation systems that not only guide you to your destination but also incorporate information regarding the latest weather and traffic conditions to help you avoid congestion and traffic delays. Watches, digital cameras, mobile phones, music players, and other devices rely on CBIS to bring their users the latest and greatest features.

The components of a CBIS are illustrated in Figure 1.2. An organization’s technology infrastructure includes all the hardware, software, databases, networks, people, and procedures that are configured to collect, manipulate, store, and process data into information. The technology infrastructure is a set of shared IS resources that form the foundation of each computer-based information system.

People make the difference between success and failure in all organizations. Jim Collins, in his book, Good to Great, said, “Those who build great companies understand that the ultimate throttle on growth for any great company is not markets, or technology, or competition, or products. It is one thing above all others: the ability to get and keep enough of the right people.”Footnote Thus, it comes as no surprise that people are the most important element in computer-based information systems.

Good systems can enable people to produce extraordinary results. They can also boost job satisfaction and worker productivity.Footnote Information systems personnel include all the people who manage, run, program, and maintain the system, including the chief information officer (CIO), who leads the IS organization. End users are people who work directly with information systems to get results. They include financial executives, marketing representatives, and manufacturing line operators.

A **procedure** defines the steps to follow to achieve a specific end result, such as enter a customer order, pay a supplier invoice, or request a current inventory report. Good procedures describe how to achieve the desired end result, who does what and when, and what to do in the event something goes wrong. When people are well trained and follow effective procedures, they can get work done faster, cut costs, make better use of resources, and more easily adapt to change. When procedures are well documented, they can greatly reduce training costs and shorten the learning curve.

Using a CBIS involves setting and following many procedures, including those for the operation, maintenance, and security of the system. For example, some procedures describe how to gain access to the system through the use of some log-on procedure and a password. Others describe who can access facts in the database or what to do if a disaster, such as a fire, earthquake, or hurricane, renders the CBIS unusable. Good procedures can help companies take advantage of new opportunities and avoid lengthy business disruptions in the event of natural disasters. Poorly developed and inadequately implemented procedures, however, can cause people to waste their time on useless rules or result in inadequate responses to disasters.


# Information Systems in Organizations
Most organizations have a number of different information systems. When considering the role of business managers in working with IS, it is useful to divide information systems into three types: personal IS, group IS, and enterprise IS.

**Personal IS** includes information systems that improve the productivity of individual users in performing stand-alone tasks. Examples include personal productivity software, such as word-processing, presentation, and spreadsheet software.

In today’s fast-moving, global work environment, success depends on our ability to communicate and collaborate with others, including colleagues, clients, and customers. Group IS includes information systems that improve communications and support collaboration among members of a workgroup. Examples include Web conferencing software, wikis, and electronic corporate directories.

**Enterprise IS** includes information systems that organizations use to define structured interactions among their own employees and/or with external customers, suppliers, government agencies, and other business partners. Successful implementation of these systems often requires the radical redesign of fundamental work processes and the automation of new processes. Target processes may include purely internal activities within the organization (such as payroll) or those that support activities with external customers and suppliers (order processing and purchasing). Three examples of enterprise IT are transaction processing, enterprise, and interorganizational systems.

For each type of IS, certain key **organizational complements** must be in place to ensure successful implementation and use of the system. These complements include:

- **Well-trained workers.** Employees must be well trained and understand the need for the new system, what their role is in using or operating the system, and how to get the results they need from the system.

- **System support.** Trained and experienced users who can show others how to gain value from the system and overcome start-up problems.
- **Better teamwork.** Employees must understand and be motivated to work together to achieve the anticipated benefits of the system.
- **Redesigned processes.** New systems often require radical redesign of existing work processes as well as the automation of new processes.
- **New decision rights.** Employees must understand and accept their new roles and responsibilities including who is responsible for making what decisions. Roles and responsibilities often change with introduction of a new system.

Managers have an essential role to play in the successful implementation and use of information systems. That role changes depending on which type of IS system is being implemented, as shown in **Table 1.3**, which also highlights other characteristics and provides examples of each type.

### Software and Mobile Applications

**Software** consists of the computer programs that govern the operation of a particular computing device, be it desktop computer, laptop, tablet, smartphone, or some other device. There are two types of software: system software and application software. System software—such as Google’s Android or Apple’s iOS—oversees basic computer operations such as start-up, controls access to system resources, and manages memory and files. Application software, such as Microsoft Office, allows you to accomplish specific tasks, including editing text documents, creating graphs, and playing games. Both system software and application software are needed for all types of computers, from small handheld devices to large supercomputers. In choosing application software, you must choose software that will work with the operating system installed on your computing device.

As of June 2015, 1.6 million applications were available for devices that run under the Android operating system and roughly the same (1.5 million) available for download from Apple’s App Store.
>The number of apps for each operating system is increasing by roughly 25,000 to 50,000 per month.

Business application software can be categorized by whether it is intended to be used by an individual, a small business, or a large multinational enterprise. For example, Quicken has long been a favorite accounting application for individuals who need money management and budgeting tools to help them watch their spending, increase their savings, and avoid late fees with alerts on upcoming payment due dates. QuickBooks, an accounting application popular with small businesses, enables users to create invoices, track sales and expenses, process credit card payments, run payroll, and generate financial, tax, and sales reports. SAP ERP Financials is an accounting application used by many large, multinational organizations to manage the complexities of global accounting and reporting requirements. SAP’s software records all financial transactions in a comprehensive general ledger; supports sophisticated reporting requirements; provides management accounting tools for orders, projects, cost centers, and profit centers; enables the speedy and accurate closing of the firm’s books; and helps manage risk and compliance across accounting and finance.

An important trend in the design of business application software is the attempt to imitate the look, feel, and intuitive ease of use associated with consumer apps that can be downloaded from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store. Indeed, usability and user-interface design are key factors in delivering apps that business users will actually use. In some organizations, employees can log on to enterprise app stores to acquire the latest company software and software upgrades. This trend of consumer technology practices influencing the way business software is designed and delivered is called the **consumerization of IT.**

CDW is a leading provider of integrated information solutions to corporate customers in small, medium, and large private and public organizations in the United States and Canada. The firm has established its App Marketplace Web site (http://appmarketplace.cdw.com) where customers’ employees can identify leading enterprise mobile app solutions. The Web site is easy to navigate with apps organized by industry and app functions. The apps there have already been vetted by CDW to perform effectively and reliably. In addition, for those needing custom mobile apps, the Web site identifies mobile app partners who have a proven track record of building, deploying, and updating top enterprise applications.

### Database Systems and Big Data

A **database** is an organized collection of facts and information, typically consisting of two or more related data files. An organization’s database can contain facts and information on customers, employees, inventory, sales, online purchases, and much more. A database is essential to the operation of a computer-based information system.

As anyone who works in marketing or sales knows, one of the biggest challenges that any business faces is the ability to generate new leads in an effort to locate customers. As businesses have looked for ways to meet this challenge, numerous vendors have seized the opportunity by offering access to databases of potential clients in various industries, as shown in **Table 1.4.**

![table1.4](table1.4.png)

A **data warehouse** is a database that stores large amounts of historical data in a form that readily supports analysis and management decision making. In a process called the **extract-transform-load (ETL)** process, raw data is extracted from various sources, transformed into a format that will support the analysis to be performed, and then loaded into the data warehouse. Data warehouses frequently hold a huge amount of data; they often contain five years or more of data. Many organizations employ data warehouses to hold the data they need to make key business decisions:

- Walmart operates separate data warehouses for Walmart and Sam’s Club. Through these data warehouses, the company allows suppliers access to almost any data they could possibly need to determine which of their products are selling, how fast, and even whether they should redesign their packaging to fit more product on store shelves.

- Harrah’s (part of the Caesar’s Entertainment casino empire) uses a data warehouse to determine how much money particular gamblers are willing to lose in a day before they will decide not to come back the next day.
- Continental Airlines uses a data warehouse to help it determine who its most valuable customers are and to find ways to keep them satisfied—for example, by proactively making alternative travel arrangements for them if their flights get delayed.
- Macy’s uses a terabyte-sized data warehouse to target improvements in four key areas of its e-commerce business: measuring the profitability and effectiveness of banner advertising, analyzing customer interactions and paths through its Web site, improving fulfillment capabilities, and correlating online sales with store sales to cross-sell and upsell customers across its distribution channels.

The digital universe (the collection of all data that exists) is doubling in size every two years as shown in **Figure 1.4.**Footnote Organizations are challenged by this rapid growth and at the same time scrambling to take advantage of the opportunities provided by this data. **Big data** is a term used to describe data collections that are so enormous (think petabytes or larger) and complex (from sensor data to social media data) that traditional data management software, hardware, and analysis processes are incapable of dealing with them. To gain a perspective on the quantity of data some organizations are struggling to manage, consider that the amount of data traveling over mobile networks alone is expected to exceed 10 exabytes per month by 2016.Footnote **Table 1.5 defines the units of measure for data.


![figure1.4](figure1.4.png)
![table1.5](table1.5.png)

To avoid being paralyzed by information overload, organizations and indeed society itself must find a way to deal with this oncoming tsunami of data. This challenge has several aspects, including how to choose which subset of data to keep, where and how to store the data, how to find the nuggets of useful data that are relevant to the decision making at hand, and how to derive real value from the relevant data.

Ideally, the many challenges associated with big data will be conquered, and more data will lead to more accurate, insightful analyses and better decision making, which in turn, will result in deliberate actions and improved business results. For that to happen, society will need to address the many issues associated with big data, including concerns over invasions of privacy and the potential for overly intrusive monitoring of individuals by governments and organizations.
